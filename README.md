# Inventory Checker for Bestbuy and Newegg
This project can be used to get an out of stock item on Bestbuy or Newegg.

## How To Use  
Put your out of stock item's link in "links", found on line 13.  Then, choose how often you want to check the links using the time.sleep argument on line 52, if it's too quick it may stop working.

## What to have installed
You must have bs4 and requests installed by using the pip command (pip install program) using the terminal.  If pip is not installed, ensure Python is added to your system's path.
